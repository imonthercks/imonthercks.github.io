## Welcome to my brain-dump

This site is sure to be littered with random code and other information from the variety of technologies I like to experiment with both for professional and personal interests.

I'm really not creating this site for public consumption, but figured it was worth having for any information I thought might be helpful to share with the general community.  If you have just stumbled across this site, then Welcome!
